# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis
This repository will fit an LDA classifier for making binary classification. The results are reported with 10-fold CV error estimates.
Classification report with a confusion matrix are also generated. 
This also helps to check distribution of your dataset (whether the data is parametric or non-parametric in nature).
Use the script "box_cox_transformation.py" to convert your non-parametric data into parametric and then try to fit the LDA classifier 
on the transformed paramteric data.
